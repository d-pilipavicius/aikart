# aiKart

## Overview

`aiKart` is a flashcard study helper app built with ASP.NET Core and React. The project aims to facilitate collaborative development and meets various requirements including LINQ, file streams, dependency injection, and more.

## System Requirements

- .NET SDK (5.0 or later)
- Node.js (14.x or later)
- npm (6.x or later)
- Git (optional but recommended)

## Initial Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository (Optional)

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Navigate to the cloned directory.

```bash
cd aiKart
```

### 2. Install .NET Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Install Node.js Dependencies

Navigate to the `ClientApp` folder within your project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Connect to your database

Create a separate JSON file named `dbconnection.json` and place it in your project directory.

This file should contain your connection string:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection" : "Host=database_hostname; Port=port_num; Database=database_name; Username=database_username; Password=password"
   }
}
```

Install the tools

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

Create tables in the database

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### Populating the Database with seed (OPTIONAL)

In the project dir update the `Seed.cs`file with decks and cards that you want to add to the database.

Run the following command to seed the database:

```bash
dotnet run seeddata
```

## How to Run

### Backend

To run the backend, navigate to the project directory and execute:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This will start the ASP.NET Core backend server. By default, it should run on `https://localhost:7006` and `http://localhost:5277` as per your `launchSettings.json`.

### Frontend

The frontend should automatically be served by the backend through a development proxy when you run `dotnet run`. You can access it by navigating to the backend server URL in your web browser.

## Additional Tools

### ESLint & Prettier

For consistent code styling, it's recommended to set up ESLint and Prettier. These can be installed as development dependencies and integrated into your IDE.

### Unit Testing

For backend, you can use xUnit which integrates well with the .NET ecosystem.
For frontend, the React project template often comes with Jest.

To run backend tests, navigate to the `Aikart.Tests` folder and run:

```bash
dotnet test
```

To see unit test coverage, run:

```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true
```

To run frontend tests, navigate to the `ClientApp` folder and run:

```bash
npm test
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **dotnet command not found**
   - Make sure the .NET SDK is installed and the `PATH` is set correctly.
  
2. **npm command not found**
   - Make sure Node.js and npm are installed and the `PATH` is set correctly.

3. **Separate CMD Window for Server**
   - This is expected behavior when running both the frontend and backend through a single command. The separate window hosts a development proxy for rerouting requests from the frontend to the backend.

4. **The current working directory does not contain a project or solution file**
   - Make sure you've navigated to the correct project folder "\aiKart"
